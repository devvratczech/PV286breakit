1.	Introduction: This document serves as the README for a Banking Application, designed as a command-line interface tool for managing financial transactions within a banking system. It covers basic banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and balance checks, as well as advanced functionalities like transaction backing and batch processing.
2.	Project Structure: The project consists of three main components: -
(a)	common.h: Defines the basic structures and functions necessary for the operation of the bank accounts and transactions. This includes data structures for account balances, transaction backing, and essential function declarations for handling these elements.
(b)	Project.cpp: The main executable file that implements the functions declared in common.h and handles command-line arguments to perform operations like deposits, transfers, and account balance checks.
(c)	help.c: Contains help functions that output usage instructions for the various help commands supported by the application. This aids users in understanding how to correctly execute commands.
3.	Key Components
(a)	Account Structures: Define the attributes of bank accounts and their transactions.
(b)	Transactional Functions: Include capabilities for adding transactions, deleting them, showing balances, and processing batch transactions.
(c)	Security Functions: Methods like secureFileOpen ensure safe file handling, crucial for maintaining transaction logs.
(d)	Helper Functions: Assist in operations like string copying and secure data erasure.
4.	Compilation and Execution:	To compile and run this application, ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standard or later. 
To run the application, use:
./tx
5.	Supported Commands and Operations
 (a)	Deposit: Add funds to a specified account.
(b)	Withdraw: Remove funds from a specified account.
(c)	Transfer: Move funds between two accounts.
(d)	Balance: Check the current balance of an account.
(e)	Settle: Automates the reconciliation of accounts to ensure balance across the bank.
(f)	Delete: Removes transactions based on specified criteria.
(g)	Batch: Process transactions in bulk from a specified file.
(h)	Back: Establishes a backup relationship between accounts for transaction security.
6.	Command Usage:Here are the command formats to operate the banking system:
(a)	Deposit: ./tx deposit --account <account_name> --amount <amount> --timestamp <timestamp>
(b)	Withdraw: ./tx withdraw --account <account_name> --amount <amount>
(c)	Transfer: ./tx transfer --from <source_account> --to <destination_account> --amount <amount> --timestamp <timestamp>
(d)	Balance: ./tx balance --account <account_name>
(e)	Batch Processing: ./tx batch <filepath>
7.	Security Features:		The application implements several security measures to ensure safe operation, including Secure file handling to prevent unauthorized access, functions that utilize OpenSSL for secure memory handling when enabled and validation checks to ensure the integrity of account names and transaction details.
Conclusion
8.	This Banking Application provides a robust platform for managing banking operations through a command-line interface. It offers a comprehensive suite of functions for handling various banking tasks efficiently and securely. For detailed help on each command, users can access help directly through the command line by invoking the application with the --help option followed by the command name.
